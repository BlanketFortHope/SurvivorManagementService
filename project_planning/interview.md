**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">II. LIFE COURSE</span>**

A.  **LIFE EVENTS **

> Matt’s life has largely centered on his time in the life these past
> two years. When Matt was fourteen, he was approached by one of his
> mother’s boyfriends. He was groomed for six months before he started
> seeing “tricks.” Matt started to trust his trafficker because he was
> feeling alienated at school when he came out as bisexual. He lost his
> friends, and his mother was working a lot as well. Matt lacked a
> father figure due to his biological father and mother divorcing after
> two years of physical abuse at the hands of Matt’s father. Matt
> latched to his trafficker because of the time he spent with Matt,
> attention Matt received, and gifts Matt was given. However, in the
> past two years, Matt has seen dozens of tricks, and has caught an STI
> as a result.

**III. ENVIRONMENT**

A.  **SOCIAL GROUPS**

> Matt is not socially active. For the past two years he has had
> interaction almost solely with his trafficker and tricks. He was kept
> socially isolated and was not able to go out into public without his
> trafficker. He was not allowed chances to talk with other individuals
> while out, and was punished if he did. He was forbidden from social
> media and internet access and did not have any social interaction that
> way.

**B. FORMAL ORGANIZATIONS**

> Matt is involved in no formal organizations. He has not been in school
> or church for the past two years.

> old. Jane’s current location is unknown. Jane immigrated to America
> from Haiti when she was very young. Jane was an elementary school
> teacher who worked long hours. She has been married once, to Matt’s
> father, Robert. Jane was married to Matt’s father until he began
> physically abusing both her and Matt when Matt was eight. Two years
> later, Jane kicked Robert out and kept Matt with her. Jane lives alone
> now in the same house Matt grew up in. She has dated since then, and
> this is how Matt came into contact with his trafficker.
>
> ****Father –**** Matt’s father is Robert T. He is deceased but was 53
> years old at his death. Robert was the janitor and picked up odd jobs
> around the city. Robert abused alcohol and then began to physically

> relationship. Robert has been out of Matt’s life for the past six
> years.

> in line with American teen culture because of his experiences the past
> two years.

**THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE & IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE**

Matt is not developed along to where his chronological age is at. He
appears to still be in the trust versus mistrust stage of Erikson’s
Psychosocial Theory of Development. This stage is four stages behind
where Matt should be based on his chronological age.

Implications for Social Work practice could include methods to help
foster Matt’s growth through the trust versus mistrust stage. Matt is
focused solely on survival; however, as Erikson points out, he should
now be focused on identity development. It is critical for the case
worker assigned to Matt’s recovery to give Matt resources to plan for
the future rather than focusing only on imminent survival. One way this
could come about is through vocational training and continual education
through the form of the GRE. It is important to connect Matt socially to
carry along development. Case workers should also focus on coping skills
and should watch for attachments forming during Matt’s time in long term
care.
